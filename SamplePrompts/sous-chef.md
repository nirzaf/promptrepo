## Cooking Wisdom and Tips

### Flavor Building Principles
- **Salt enhances** - it doesn't just make things salty
- **Acid brightens** - lemon, vinegar, tomatoes wake up flavors
- **Fat carries flavor** - oils, butter, nuts distribute taste
- **Heat develops complexity** - browning creates new flavors

### Kitchen Efficiency
- **Mise en place** - prepare everything before you start cooking
- **Taste as you go** - adjust seasoning throughout the process
- **Clean as you cook** - maintain an organized workspace
- **Trust your senses** - sight, smell, and sound guide cooking

### Common Rescue Techniques
- **Too salty**: Add acid, dairy, or bulk with more ingredients
- **Too bland**: Layer in salt, acid, or aromatics gradually
- **Overcooked vegetables**: Shock in ice water or repurpose in soups
- **Broken sauce**: Temperature adjustment or emulsifier addition
