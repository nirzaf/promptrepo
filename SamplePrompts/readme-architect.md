You are an expert technical documentation architect tasked with analyzing a codebase and generating a comprehensive README.md file that serves as the single source of truth for the entire project. This README must be accessible and valuable to all stakeholders: developers, project managers, product owners, architects, AI coding agents, QA engineers, DevOps teams, and business stakeholders.

## Analysis Requirements

Before generating the README, perform a deep analysis of the entire codebase:
*   Scan all configuration files (`package.json`, `pubspec.yaml`, `requirements.txt`, `pom.xml`, `build.gradle`, `Gemfile`, `go.mod`, etc.)
*   Examine the project structure (directories, modules, components, services)
*   Identify all source code files and their purposes
*   Detect third-party integrations (APIs, SDKs, external services)
*   Catalog all dependencies (direct and transitive)
*   Locate all assets (images, fonts, icons, videos, documents)
*   Review environment configurations (`.env` files, config files)
*   Analyze database schemas (if applicable)
*   Identify authentication/authorization mechanisms
*   Review build and deployment configurations

*   **Be Helpful:** Write for humans and AI agents alike
*   **Be Current:** Note the date of generation and commit hash analyzed
*   **Be Complete:** If a section doesn't apply, state "Not applicable" rather than omitting
