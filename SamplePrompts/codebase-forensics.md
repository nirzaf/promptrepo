You are conducting a comprehensive forensic analysis of a codebase with unknown quality and security posture. Your mission is to identify, document, and prioritize all significant risks, vulnerabilities, and quality issues through systematic investigation and evidence-based analysis.

## 2. Forensic Investigation Framework
Execute a layered analysis across these dimensions:

### Layer 1: Architectural & Structural Forensics
*   Dissect project structure, module boundaries, and dependency graphs
*   Identify architectural anti-patterns: tight coupling, circular dependencies, god objects, anemic domain models
*   Assess scalability constraints and single points of failure
*   Evaluate separation of concerns and adherence to SOLID principles

### Layer 2: Data Flow & State Management Analysis
*   Trace complete data lifecycle: ingress → validation → processing → storage → egress
*   Map authentication/authorization flows for privilege escalation risks
*   Identify race conditions, unhandled edge cases, and state corruption vulnerabilities
*   Audit input validation, sanitization, and output encoding at all boundaries

### Layer 3: Security Vulnerability Audit (OWASP-Focused)
Systematically probe for:
*   Injection flaws (SQL, NoSQL, Command, LDAP, XPath)
*   Broken Authentication/Session Management
*   Sensitive Data Exposure (credentials, PII, tokens in logs/errors)
*   XML External Entities (XXE) and Insecure Deserialization
*   Broken Access Control and IDOR vulnerabilities
*   Security Misconfiguration (defaults, verbose errors, unnecessary features)
*   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) - stored, reflected, DOM-based
*   Insecure Dependencies with known CVEs
*   Insufficient Logging & Monitoring
*   Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

**Additional security checks:**
*   Hard-coded secrets, API keys, passwords
*   Cryptographic weaknesses (weak algorithms, improper key management)
*   Business logic flaws and authorization bypasses

### Layer 4: Code Quality & Maintainability Investigation
*   Detect code smells: duplicated logic, long methods, excessive parameters
*   Calculate cyclomatic complexity for untestable/fragile code
*   Identify dead code, unreachable branches, and unused dependencies
*   Assess error handling patterns and exception safety
*   Review logging practices for security leaks or insufficient audit trails

### Layer 5: Dependency & Infrastructure Audit
*   Enumerate all direct and transitive dependencies
*   Cross-reference against vulnerability databases (CVE, GitHub Advisory)
*   Examine configuration files: Dockerfiles, CI/CD pipelines, environment configs
*   Identify overprivileged containers, exposed ports, and insecure defaults
*   Review build scripts for supply chain risks

## 3. Deliverable: Comprehensive Forensic Report

### Executive Summary
*   Overall security posture assessment (Critical/High/Medium/Low risk)
*   Top 3-5 most severe findings requiring immediate attention
*   Strategic recommendations for security and quality improvement

### Critical Findings Registry
For each finding, document:
*   **[FINDING-ID]: [Concise Title]**
*   **Severity:** Critical | High | Medium | Low | Info
*   **Category:** Security | Architecture | Quality | Performance | Compliance
*   **Location:** `path/to/file.ext:line_number(s)`
*   **Evidence:**
    ```
    [relevant code snippet with context]
    ```
*   **Impact Analysis:** What can go wrong? Who is affected? What's the worst-case scenario?
*   **Exploit Scenario:** (For security issues) Step-by-step attack vector
*   **Root Cause:** Why does this vulnerability/flaw exist?

### Remediation Roadmap
Organize by priority tier and theme:
*   **Immediate Action Items (Critical/High)**
    *   Security hardening steps with specific code changes
    *   Quick wins that reduce attack surface
*   **Medium-Term Improvements**
    *   Architectural refactoring recommendations
    *   Code quality enhancements
    *   Testing and monitoring improvements
*   **Long-Term Strategic Initiatives**
    *   Design pattern adoption
    *   Dependency modernization strategy
    *   CI/CD security integration

### Metrics & Statistics
*   Total findings by severity
*   Findings by category breakdown
*   Code coverage gaps (if determinable)
*   Technical debt estimation
